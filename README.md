<h1>BloggingPlatform</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Our team developed an interactive blogging website that allows users to create personalized accounts, write and read articles, and interact with other users' content. The platform was implemented using a scalable three-tier architecture. Blog administrators are then authorized to view all blog users' information in a Swing-based desktop application and can make executive decisions to permanently remove users from the database.
